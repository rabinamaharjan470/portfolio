    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p><strong>Chartered Accountant</strong></p>
    <p>
        I have completed my education in Chartered Accountancy, gaining strong knowledge in
        accounting principles, financial reporting, auditing, taxation, and business laws.
        This academic background has helped me develop analytical thinking, attention to detail,
        and problem-solving skills that are valuable in both financial and technical projects.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>
            This project was my first major practical experience where I applied my academic
            knowledge to a real-world scenario. The main objective of this project was to
            understand how structured planning, documentation, and execution play a vital role
            in successful project delivery. I focused on organizing information, defining clear
            goals, and ensuring accuracy in every stage of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the development process, I learned the importance of time management and
            consistency. I faced challenges related to data handling, formatting, and maintaining
            clarity, but overcoming these challenges helped improve my problem-solving skills.
            I carefully reviewed each part of the project to ensure correctness and professional
            presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project helped me build confidence and laid a strong foundation for my future
            projects. It also improved my ability to work independently, analyze requirements,
            and deliver a complete solution with attention to detail and quality.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>
            Project 2 focused on improving my understanding of structured workflows and logical
            thinking. The goal of this project was to create a well-organized solution by breaking
            down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This approach helped ensure better
            accuracy and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            While working on this project, I learned how important documentation and clarity are.
            Every step was carefully recorded so that the process could be easily understood and
            reviewed later. I also learned how to identify errors early and correct them before
            they affected the final outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Completing this project strengthened my analytical abilities and enhanced my
            discipline in following standards and guidelines. It played a significant role in
            shaping my professional mindset and prepared me for more advanced and complex tasks.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 3</h3>
        <p>
            Project 3 was designed to further enhance my practical skills and attention to detail.
            The project required careful planning, proper organization of information, and
            consistent review to maintain high accuracy. I applied critical thinking to evaluate
            different approaches before finalizing the best solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this project, I focused on maintaining quality and professionalism. I
            learned how to manage pressure and meet deadlines while ensuring that the final output
            met expectations. This experience helped improve my decision-making and adaptability.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth. It
            reinforced the importance of patience, accuracy, and continuous improvement in any
            professional work environment.
        </p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 4</h3>
        <p>
            Project 4 was a culmination of everything I had learned from my previous projects.
            It involved applying best practices, maintaining consistency, and delivering a
            polished final result. The project required strong organizational skills and a clear
            understanding of objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            I focused heavily on reviewing and refining my work to ensure precision and clarity.
            This project helped me understand the importance of quality assurance and final checks
            before submission. I also gained confidence in handling responsibilities independently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project strengthened my professional capabilities and prepared me for
            future challenges. It reflects my dedication, discipline, and commitment to delivering
            high-quality work.
